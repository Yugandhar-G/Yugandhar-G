## About Me

I am a developer focused on building practical, scalable systems using Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality. My work centers on computer vision, real-time interaction, and full-stack engineering, with an emphasis on usability, performance, and real-world impact.

I enjoy working on problems where AI directly improves how people see, learn, and interact with their environment. My experience spans backend systems, mobile development, machine learning pipelines, and immersive 3D applications.

## Featured Project: LARIA

### LARIA – AI-Powered Vision and Augmented Reality Platform

LARIA is an application that combines real-time AI vision with immersive 3D augmented reality conversations. The platform is designed to help users understand their surroundings, interact naturally with digital entities, and stay connected across physical distance.

**Live Demo:** https://laria-ai.vercel.app/

### Core Capabilities

**AI Vision Assistance**
- Real-time object and text recognition through the camera
- Context-aware understanding of the physical environment
- Hands-free guidance for everyday tasks and navigation

**3D Augmented Reality Conversations**
- Creation of lifelike 3D personas from images
- Real-time, spatial conversations in the user’s environment
- Designed for memory preservation, communication, and presence

### Real-World Use Cases

| Domain | Application | Value |
|------|------------|-------|
| Accessibility | Vision assistance for visually impaired users | Increased independence |
| Education | Visual and contextual learning support | Faster comprehension |
| Professional | On-site identification and guidance | Reduced task friction |
| Consumer | Product recognition and comparison | Informed decisions |
| Communication | Remote presence through AR personas | Stronger connection |
| Memory | Digital preservation of people and moments | Long-term remembrance |
